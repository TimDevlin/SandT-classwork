    <h1>How to Care for Fido</h1>

    <p>Fido is a generic dog, who requires generic care. Search the web for
    information about dogs, and you will find lots of information that will
    help you care for Fido.</p>
    <p>If Fido barks, he is trying tell you something. He is not necessarily
    trying to tell you anything important. There may be a bird nearby.</p>
    <p class="important">Fido needs food, water, and not to be left inside all day. He likes to
    go for walks in the park. Don't forget to bring a poop bag!</p>
    <p>Here is a list of Fido's favroite toys:</p>
      <ul class="important">
        <li>squeaky bone</li>
        <li>stick</li>
        <li>rawhide bone</li>
        <li>shoelaces</li>
      </ul>
